# Intro to Data Sources

notes:
so today we are going to have a quick introduction to the suggested data sources that you might want to investigate for the projects in this class, and specifically for the GDS MiP that will be discussed next week

these are resources that are well vetted, *well documented* and are (relatively) easy to access and so are good to use for our kind of work

we will also have time for you to brainstorm your own "good" sources for data and/or give more info about these!

---

# Data Sources

Our data sources.  We will explore:

 * data.world
 * data.gov
 * data.illinois.gov
 * data.humdata.org


notes:
we'll be exploring these things more with GDS next week and the one after, but we'll get a quick intro here


---

## [data.world](https://data.world/)

To see datasets without logging in: ~~https://data.world/datasets/open-data~~ 

Unfortunately, you do have to log in now!

notes:

---

## [data.world/search](https://data.world/search)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dataSources/dataworld_searchChicago.png" data-background-size="auto 85%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" aria-label="[Contents of data.world/datasets/open-data]" -->

notes:
you'll see a list like this and a search function

look for chicago and pick one

---

## [data.world](https://data.world/)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dataSources/dataworld_chicagoData.png" data-background-size="auto 85%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" aria-label="[Data view of Chicago City Council Votes and highlight on Explore this dataset button. Click this button for more info.]" -->

notes:
click on explore

you *can* link to apps, but probably easier to download 

---

## [data.gov](https://data.gov/)

All US data -- A LOT of data.

notes:
search -- climate and arctic

search -- IMLS

---

## [data.illinois.gov](https://data.illinois.gov/)

Keep in mind: not all local governments use this (e.g. Urbana only recently started updating here)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dataSources/dataIllinois_urbana.png" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" aria-label="[Looking at the contents of data.illinois.gov/group/local-government]" -->

notes: 
look at local governments

---

## [data.humdata.org](https://data.humdata.org/)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dataSources/dataHum_climate.png" data-background-size="auto 60%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" aria-label="[The webpage data.humdata.org/dataset]" -->

notes:
this can be very useful data for this class and your final presentations

---

# Data Sources

We will will divide into groups and explore:

 * data.world
 * data.gov
 * data.illinois.gov
 * data.humdata.org

Prepare an introduction to between one and three datasets you identify that you
are interested in exploring.  Think about these things:

 * What format is the data in?
 * What is the type of data (rows, columns, connectivity, etc)
 * What story might be hidden?
 
Summaries will be posted on the Miro board for this in class activity.


notes:
use about 10 minutes to explore the data together

We'll be pulling from these (and other datasets) for your first minor project next week

1. find interesting data
1. answer these questions together
1. you do *not* have to do any visualizations with this data at this step (some of the websites will have their own viz options as well)

**more about this next week and/or later today based on time!!**

You can use other datasets *however* be sure to check with the instructional team -- not all datasets have stringent enough provenance information to be trusted!

Be prepared to share what you find!
