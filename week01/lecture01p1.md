## Some notes about this Class

Participation in this class is absolutely key.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

You will be tasked with talking, creating, sharing, and discussing.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

notes:
be aware that participation in this class is key to success

---

## Participation Guidelines

We ask that you:

 * Participate in class (questions, comments, discussion)
 * Engage with your group in class and outside of class (more about assignment groups next week)
 * Use Canvas resources & email (preferred) for communication outside of class

---

## Participation Guidelines - Presentations

<div>All presentations will be <b>in person</b> - no hybrid/online options available.</div><!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<br />

<div>This includes presentations that will take place in the last two weeks of class.</div><!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

notes:
Please note this is an in person class so we expect you to be in person - there are no online/hybrid options for this class.  While we will make recordings of the first class before the drop-date, we will not be recording other classes.

**be aware** this includes ALL in class presentations, including your final presentations which will take place in the last 2 weeks of class - you will need to be here for these assignments to present with your group.

## Grading - Categories

 * 10% -- Participation/Attendance
 * 10% -- Reading Quizzes (\~weekly, more heavily toward the start of class)
 * 10% -- Graded in class activities (\~weekly or every other week, individual and group)
 * 25% -- Minor Projects (MiP, individual & groups)
 * 45% -- Major Projects (MP, groups)

notes:
with this idea of the course, let's look at the overall way grading is going to work in this course

you will dive into the details more for the syllabus quiz, which is an assignment due next week designed to get you familiar with these details :D

some of the assignments are still being developed (you'll see notes in the assignments where this is the case) so expect a few things to be "flushed out" over the next few weeks

There *IS* a reading list however that you can access to "look ahead" at all of the reading for the course.

also about reading quizzes: as these are new, there might be some errors in them!  if you think we got something wrong, let us know so we can fix it and update your grade accordingly!

## Grading - Categories

 * 10% -- Participation/Attendance
 * 10% -- Reading Quizzes (\~weekly, more heavily toward the start of class)
 * 10% -- Graded <font color="red">in class</font> activities (\~weekly or every other week, individual and group)
 * 25% -- Minor Projects (MiP, individual & groups)
 * 45% -- Major Projects (MP, groups)

notes:

**be aware** the in class activities are really "in class" activities in that some times there will be more than one assigned during class, in which case, any beyond the "main" one will be due several days after the course

more details on the graded in class activities next week when we start using them! as folks are still shifting around classes, we won't be grading any in class stuff this week

## Presentation Goals & Purpose


notes:
there will be several presentations in class, each has their own purpose and are meant to scaffold you toward your final data story

---

## Presentation Goals & Purpose

  * MP1: Tweet Critique
    * first practice presenting, 
    * critical analysis of data viz, 
    * practice thinking critically about data presentation

notes:
The first will be the Tweet Critique.

This is meant to
1. just get right into some public speaking with your group and 
2. think critically about visualizations of data you come across on social media

---

## Presentation Goals & Purpose

  * MP1: Tweet Critique
    * first practice presenting, 
    * critical analysis of data viz, 
    * practice thinking critically about data presentation
  * MiP3: Community Data Story
    * a short time span "we need a recommendation" type talk,
    * AND practice for your Final Data Story as a group

notes:
Your next talk will be the Community Data Story.  This has 2 main purposes:
1. it serves as practice for requests from employers along the lines of "we need a recommendation based on data"
2. it will be an opportunity for you to present with your group that will be used for your Final Data Story and to get feedback on your presentation style

---

## Presentation Goals & Purpose

  * MP1: Tweet Critique
    * first practice presenting, 
    * critical analysis of data viz, 
    * practice thinking critically about data presentation
  * MiP3: Community Data Story
    * a short time span "we need a recommendation" type talk,
    * AND practice for your Final Data Story as a group
  * MP2: Final Data Stories -- the "big one", culminating presentation

notes:
And then finally, we have "the big one" -- your final data story.

This will showcase all of the hard work you put in toward telling a great data story!

## Tools

notes:
let's talk briefly about the tools we'll be using in this class

---

## Tools

 * [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/)
 * [PowerBI](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=power-bi)
 * [Twine](https://twinery.org/)

notes:


google data studio one of the tools we'll use to build interactive visualizations in in-class activities -- the nice thing about this tool is that it is 100% free to use with all features.  It also "plays well" with google products like google spreadsheets

powerbi is another visualization tool we'll use to build interactive viz.  Whats nice about this is that it "plays nice" with microsoft products like excel.  We'll be using the online-only, free version of PowerBI for this course

twine is used to make interactive text & image based online data stories and games


---

## Tools

 * [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/)
 * [PowerBI](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=power-bi)
 * [Twine](https://twinery.org/)
 
There is *not* a programming requirement or prerequisite for this course.

notes:
please note that I am assuming that there are folks here that have zero programming background and that is not only fine, but it is great!

we are going to be using these resources in a way that does not require programming

---

## Tools

 * [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/) -- familiarity with Google Sheets
 * [PowerBI](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=power-bi) -- familiarity with Excel
 * [Twine](https://twinery.org/) -- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), HTML (a tiny bit)
 
There is *not* a programming requirement or prerequisite for this course.

notes:
with that in mind, if you are newer to programming and/or data analysis there are a few things you might want to check out including gaining some 
familiarity with Excel and/or Google sheets

for twine we will mostly be making use of a Markdown-like syntax which is just a more intuative way to use HTML where things like bullet points are formatted with astrexies instead of fancy HTML formatting. 

There will be one or two HTML tags we might use to do things like include images, but we won't be doing anything super fancy

---

## Tools

 * [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/) -- familiarity with Google Sheets
 * [PowerBI](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=power-bi) -- familiarity with Excel
 * [Twine](https://twinery.org/) -- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), HTML (a tiny bit)
 
There is *not* a programming requirement or prerequisite for this course.

Recommended tutorials & recordings are posted at the top of the "Modules" part of the Canvas course page.

notes:
for these topics, we will post some suggested resources including tutorials and recordings before class -- we have one for this class, but it is the first class so it is hard to do things before!

---

## Plagiarism

Academic integrity is vital to this course.  The _stories_ you tell and the
_visualizations_ you create must be your own, both in actuality and in
character.

However, there are many reasons to seek out assistance and help. We insist that
you cite every fragment of code that you utilize online.

notes:
a few more things before we get into an introduction to storytelling

please see the policies about citations in the syllabus!

---

## Participation

* 10% of total grade

Let's practice taking attendance!

notes:
as mentioned before, we need all of you to be here on time -- we'll give folks a 5 minute grace period before taking attendance at the start of class, otherwise you'll get partial credit

we'll take attendance using a variety of methods throughout the course, but let's practice our first one

**give TA the mic**

We actually won't be "counting" the attendances before the 10th day (which is next week), so this was just practice, but we will be putting in attendance grades today so folks can see what that will look like.

We will delete today's grades after 10th day.

Also, we will be dropping the 2 lowest scores (so you can miss up to 2 weeks w/o penalty), but that won't be implemented until we start taking attendance "for real" next week.

Again, this means your attendance grade will change next week, but we want to practice how this will work before then.

---

## Quick tour of our Canvas Page!

notes:
mention modules
 * Major/Minor projects at top
 * each week will have reading quizzes and in-class submission placeholders for the week
 * we will also have the lecture slides, recommended readings, and any relevant resources for the week
 * we are still adding things, but are aiming to be at least a week or more ahead with material postings!

**be sure to point out tutorials and resources at top of page!**
