# Names Activity

---

## Naming activity & Introduction to Each Other

We'll first give you  ~2 minutes to write down some notes/data about "your" name.  Here "your" name can be your actual name, a nickname for you, the name of a pet, favorite place, etc.

Then we are going to break up into groups, where you'll chat with each other about your *name* (or the name of a place, 
person, animal, etc that is meaningful to you).

notes:
**set timer for 2 minutes**

**Let's break into groups!**

Talk a little about your name.  Does it mean something?  Where does it come from?

(Afterward, we'll reconvene, allow for a few people to share a bit.)

notes:
**set timer for ~5-7 min!**

**allow folks to share for ~5 min**

## Names - Visualization

In your groups, we want you to think about telling a story about names.

 * How do we tell a visual story about this?
 * What information -- *data* -- can we obtain about names?

In groups -- sketch out some ideas in our class Miro board.

A few things:
 1. one person in your group will need to be logged in to google through your @illinois.edu address
 1. make sure you are only working on *your group's* board
 
**And go!**
(Check out Miro link)

notes:
**go through and then ask if folks have questions**

**check in at 10 minute mark**
