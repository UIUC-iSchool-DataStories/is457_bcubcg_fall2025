# Expectations of you for presentations

notes:
we'll be having some presentations starting next week and we want to make sure we have a supportive environment for this process

## Expectations of you as an audience

notes:
some expectations we have of you as an audience are...

---

## Expectations of you as an audience

We expect you to be:

* on time -- we will start presentations right after we take attendance

notes:
we expect you to be on time -- we are going to start presentations right after attendance (so presenters don't have to sit around worrying for too long!)

---

## Expectations of you as an audience

We expect you to be:

* on time -- we will start presentations right after we take attendance
  * life happens -- if you are late, be sure to wait until you here a break after a presentation to enter (listen for applause!)

notes:
but look, life happens -- its possible something will happen and you'll have to be late

in this case, be sure you don't walk in while a group is presenting -- this is super disruptive!

you can just wait to either hear my talking OR for applause between presentation groups

## Expectations of you as an audience

We expect you to be:

* on time -- we will start presentations right after we take attendance
  * life happens -- if you are late, be sure to wait until you here a break after a presentation to enter (listen for applause!)
* an engaged audience


notes:
we also expect you to be an engaged audience -- this is a great opportunity for you to practice your active listening skills!

part of being a good audience is to be clearly listening (i.e. not on your phone/computer unless you are taking notes)

we will also be giving feedback to each group that we expect subsequent groups to incorporate into their presentations, so be sure you are taking notes on some of those

## Expectations of you as an audience

We expect you to be:

* on time -- we will start presentations right after we take attendance
  * life happens -- if you are late, be sure to wait until you here a break after a presentation to enter (listen for applause!)
* an engaged audience
* a supportive audience -- "if you think you have a criticism, as a question"

notes:

feel free to ask questions at the end

There is a great quote I like from Prof. Kate McDowell who also teaches this class which is **read** which I really like as a way to make any feedback constructive and conversational as well as useful

## Logistics for presenters

notes:
now onto logistics for presenters

---

## Logistics for presenters

* Presentations will be run from your own laptop

notes:
What does this mean for you practically? ...

---

## Logistics for presenters

* Presentations will be run from your own laptop
  * make sure you bring in any connectors/dongles you might need (the connection is HDMI in class)

notes:
the instructional team will do their best to remember to bring dongles, but if you have a special connector you are better off bringing your own

and better safe than sorry!

## Logistics for presenters

* Presentations will be run from your own laptop
  * make sure you bring in any connectors/dongles you might need (the connection is HDMI in class)
  * you can use presenter notes, but *IDEALLY* we should not be able to tell you are using them

notes:
at this stage, we expect that folks may need to rely heavily on notecards or presenter notes on their computers, that is OK for now!

looking forward -- we really want you to "hone" your presentation skills by being able to "tell from the heart" without notes, or at the very least, faking it really well!

this will be a more stringent requirement for subsequent presentations, so for now, do your best to try to not rely on your presenter notes too heavily

## Logistics for presenters

* Presentations will be run from your own laptop
  * make sure you bring in any connectors/dongles you might need (the connection is HDMI in class)
  * you can use presenter notes, but *IDEALLY* we should not be able to tell you are using them
* We will start a few minutes after 3:05pm to have enough time for presentations + feedback

notes:
we will start with presentations right after attendance in order to give folks enough time for lots of feedback ...

  * you can use presenter notes, but *IDEALLY* we should not be able to tell you are using them
* We will start a few minutes after 3:05pm to have enough time for presentations + feedback
  * Groups will be called randomly

notes:
... if you are presenting, you need to be extra sure that you are on time since we'll be calling groups randomly

* We will start a few minutes after 3:05pm to have enough time for presentations + feedback
  * Groups will be called randomly
  * Groups who are not all present when they are called will lose points, and group members who do not present will get a "0" on this assignment (see Rubric for more details)

notes:
please note that we expect all group members to be present when their group is called and actively present

*if an emergency comes up, we can reschedule* but if its last minute, official documentation might be required (syllabus for how to provide documentation)
