# How can visualizations designed to be misleading?

notes:
in your tweet critique assignments, you are exploring some visualizations "out in the wild" that are misleading

but what are some of the design choices that go into making misleading visualizations and how can we avoid them?

notes:

in lecture 6.1, we discussed some "rules of thumb" when making visualizations, but typically "rules of thumb" focus on making clear visualizations without thinking about if they can be misleading in anyway

From the MiP2a/b Canvas page:
> The purpose of this assignment is to learn to identify bad data storytelling and correct it with strong and successful arguments. You will develop your skills at identifying a bad data visualization or visualization villainy out in the world and correcting it with a better data story.

notes:

in the next minor project, we'll investigate some "villainous" visualizations and think about how to make them clearer

and we'll do this in 2 parts -- a proposal that you'll get feedback on and a final submission

## (Against) Visualization for Villainy

### MiP2a: Proposal -- Preparation

notes:

the first part of this minor project, is a proposal -- this is an opportunity to get feedback on your analysis plan so that you're in a strong position to move forward with your final submission

---

## (Against) Visualization for Villainy

### MiP2a: Proposal -- Preparation

First, you will read/watch the Visualization for Villainy article/talk:
 * Article: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06007
 * Viz for Villainy video (33 min including Q&A): https://youtu.be/O27FEqWRUtY?list=TLGG--yHfIB4E4MyNTA2MjAyNA&t=5240

notes:
you will first start off by reading/watching the article and video associated with "visualization for villainy" 

make sure you look over these items, since you'll be asked to reference them for your proposal and final submission

Next, you will be finding a "villainous" visualization. <font color="white">No duplication will be allowed, each group must select something unique. You can't use the same visualization you used for your MP1 (but you can use another groups, if none of your group members was in that MP1 group). </font>

notes:
note -- it must be villainous!

You might start from one of the following sources, but you can look beyond if you find another source of bad data visualization:
 * Bad data viz on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/datavisualization/comments/nvzpub/send_me_bad_data_vis
 * WTF Viz: https://viz.wtf/

## (Against) Visualization for Villainy

### MiP2a: Proposal -- Submission

notes:
once you find your visualization *and the data associated* you'll submit a proposal with your group

## (Against) Visualization for Villainy

### MiP2a: Proposal -- Submission

In this portion of the assignment you will, step by step:

---

## (Against) Visualization for Villainy

### MiP2a: Proposal -- Submission

In this portion of the assignment you will, step by step:
 1. Identify the "villainous" data visualization

notes:
you will clearly identify the villainous viz

---

## (Against) Visualization for Villainy

### MiP2a: Proposal -- Submission

In this portion of the assignment you will, step by step:
 1. Identify the "villainous" data visualization
 1. Identify the dataset it is meant to be drawn from

notes:
you will also identify the dataset that the visualization uses -- *this part can be tricky*

it may not be obvious where the data is coming from, and the source of the data might not be clearly linked -- you will likely have to do some digging

we'll have an activity later today to help you search for some of these possibilities

---

## (Against) Visualization for Villainy

### MiP2a: Proposal -- Submission

In this portion of the assignment you will, step by step:
 1. Identify the "villainous" data visualization
 1. Identify the dataset it is meant to be drawn from
 1. Submit a 200–300 word abstract describing your plan for analysis including which visualization you plan to recreate and what tools.  While you can use whatever tool you would like (Excel, Google Data Studio, R, Python, etc), if not using PowerBI be sure to explicitly address why PowerBI cannot create the visualization you wish to make.

notes:
you'll submit a short abstract laying out your plan for analysis, including tools.  The goal is for you to use PowerBI to create your better visualization using the data you find associated with the villainous viz, but if there is a reason your group feels PowerBI is not the tool for this, you should discuss why this is.

 1. Include all relevant citations, including references to the original visualization and any available information about its author (person or organization) and its context

notes:
be sure to include citations, we are a library school after all, include any references to not only the original viz, but parts of the reading and video you'll be using to motivate your analysis (and any other outside citations)

 1. Include all relevant citations, including references to the original visualization and any available information about its author (person or organization) and its context

Your visualization **must be "villainous" and not just "bad"** -- be sure to reference the reading and video when discussing this distinction and how it applies to your chosen viz. (We will have an in-class activity that guides groups through this.) 

notes:

please note -- your visualization must be beyond just "bad" but actually misleading and used for villainy!  We expect you to reference teh video & reading to support why your viz is villainous and not just bad.

Again, our in class activity will help with this.
